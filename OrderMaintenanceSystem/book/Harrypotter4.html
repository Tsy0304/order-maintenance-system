                <div class="desc"><p>Harry Potter is in his fourth year at Hogwarts. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to find out about the mysterious event to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for hundreds of years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - not even by Wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly.</p>
